# Blank Presets for Univrm

I was frustrated at how much time I was spending going through setting up my presets on models. It's a lot. There's work involved.
So I picked apart the c# code that controls it in Univrm 0.92.0_02487, and added the ones I use all the time. So, all of the visemes, as well as the arkit shapes.

This is just the blank presets. With this, I'm assuming you've already created the shapekeys and morphs you need to make these mixes

Here's the list:

## Instructions

**Step 1** Unzip the contents of this file to the assets folder of your project. If you drag it directly into your project in Unity, the system will move it to a safe location where it doesn't overwrite anything. But overwriting key pieces of Univrm is what we want to do.

**Step 2** There really isn't a step 2. Just load up your unity project, and let it adjust to your modified code.
